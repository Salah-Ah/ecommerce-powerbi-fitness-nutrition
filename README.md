# 📊 E-Commerce Analytics – Fitness & Nutrition Products

Power BI End-to-End Business Intelligence Project (2010–2013)

## 🔹 Background & Overview

This project analyzes the business (B2B) performance of an E-commerce & Retail company specializing in Fitness & Nutrition products, including Protein, Vitamins, Supplements, Gym Equipment, and Sports Clothing.

The dataset consists of multiple transactional Excel/CSV files representing:

Sales Transactions (Fact Table)

Return Transactions (Fact Table)

The analysis covers the period from January 2010 to December 2013 and focuses on transforming raw transactional data into executive-level insights using Power BI.

The dataset was provided as a course business dataset and is used here strictly for educational and portfolio purposes with no publishing restrictions.

## 🔹 Tools & Technologies

Power BI

Power Query (ETL & Data Cleaning)

DAX (Measures & KPIs)

CSV / Excel Data Sources

## 🔹 Executive Summary

During the period 2010–2013, the business (B2B) achieved strong revenue growth, reaching:

* Total Revenue: $81M

* Total Cost: $25M

* Total Profit: $56.77M

* Gross Margin: ~70%

* Total Orders: 3,796

* Total Customers: 635

* Return Orders: 1,546 (41% of all orders)

* Returned Value: $6.39M (8% of revenue)

### Key strategic observations:

* The business is highly dependent on a single product category (Protein) and one dominant market (United States).

* Customer retention is weak, with a large portion of customers making only one purchase.

* Return rates are critically high, indicating potential quality or supply-chain issues.

* Despite strong top-line growth, operational risks threaten long-term sustainability.

## 🔹 Business Questions Addressed

Where does the company generate most of its revenue and profit?

Is the revenue growth healthy and sustainable?

Why are product return rates exceptionally high?

Are we retaining customers or continuously replacing them?

Which products should receive future investment?

## Data Structure

### Data model


## 🔹 Insights Deep Dive
### 📈 1. Sales Performance

Revenue grew significantly from $18M in 2011 to $34M in 2013, but Gross Margin declined from 71% to 69%.

United States dominates sales with $54M (67%) of total revenue.

Protein products alone generate 89% of total revenue ($72M) → high business concentration risk.

Warehouse channel leads sales (48%), followed closely by Supplement Stores (43.5%).

Canada ranks second with $14M but remains far behind the U.S.

### 👥 2. Customer Analysis

The majority of customers are one-time buyers, indicating weak loyalty.

Customer churn is very high:

489 customers lost in 2013 alone.

Southwest region is the most profitable with $13M profit despite a smaller customer base.

Average Order Value (AOV) is high at $21.46K, suggesting bulk or B2B purchasing behavior.

New customer acquisitions increased annually, but retention failed to keep pace.

### 🔄 3. Return Analysis

41% of all orders were returned — a critical operational issue.

57% of all customers returned at least one order.

Whey Protein has the highest return volume, followed by Meal Replacement products.

Southwest region experiences the most returns, indicating potential logistics or supplier issues.

Clear seasonality in returns during Jan, May, Aug, and Oct.

### 📅 4. Time Analysis

Year-to-date revenue shows a strong upward trend.

2011 experienced explosive growth (+3650%) compared to 2010.

Significant monthly volatility observed:

Revenue dropped 67% from May to June in one year.

December is consistently the strongest sales month.

Profit margins remain relatively stable around 72–73%.

### 🛍️ 5. Product Analysis

Products priced between $0–$1000 generate 70% of total profit.

Pure Casein Protein is the most profitable product, despite not being the most returned.

Hydrolyzed products deliver the highest AOV.

Concentrate Whey shows strong margins but high return risk.

Overall cost ratio is only 30%, reflecting healthy nominal margins.

## 🔹 Key Business Risks Identified

Extremely high return rate (41%)

Severe customer churn

Over-reliance on a single category (Protein) and single market (USA)

These risks directly threaten long-term profitability and scalability.

## 🔹 Strategic Recommendations

Perform supplier audits for Whey and Meal Replacement products.

Investigate packaging, logistics, and product quality issues in Southwest regions.

Implement Customer Retention Strategy

Introduce loyalty programs and re-engagement campaigns.

Segment high-value customers for personalized offers.

Diversify Product Revenue

Increase investment into Hydrolyzed and Casein products.

Reduce dependency on Protein alone.

Geographical Risk Diversification
